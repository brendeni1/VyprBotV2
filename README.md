# Bot Info

VyprBot is a general-purpose bot with user-based commands, a loyalty system and other interesting and fun commands to check out. I started this bot with 0 knowledge of Node.JS on November 12, 2021. This bot started as a personal project, but eventualy turned into something that I found fun and engaging. I don't see it fizzling out of existence any time soon.

# Bot Info (VyprBotv2)

The main reason that I rewrote this bot is because I wanted to clean up the code. Before, I had one index.js file. This file had over 2.3k lines of code in it, and was starting to get very crowded and filled. Having modules is a much better approach. This bot is also now written in TypeScript for my own sanity.
